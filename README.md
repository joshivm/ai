This repository contains code for different neural network architecture for example, mlp, gan, etc. This work is in progress and I'll keep adding new code as when I build one successfully. Any comments/suggestions/bugs-reports are most welcome.

- [MLP](https://github.com/vinayjoshi22/ai/tree/master/ann/mlp) : Code contains python class for mlp. Network.ipynb is an example file demonstrating use of class network.py that implements mlp.
